Description: VHD file format access library
  Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) is a file format standard which maps logical
  hard disk contents to a physical disk image format, which can then
  be more efficiently stored in a variety of different storage types,
  such as file systems or logical volumes.
  .
  VHDs are container files storing block metadata alongside a virtual
  disk's contents, in a single disk image. The metadata enables
  advanced storage backend capabilities, such as thin provisioning,
  disk image snapshotting, and coalescing of differencing disks.
  .
  Libvhd is a library to access VHD format metadata. It provides disk
  image initialization, inspection and manipulation to both VHD user
  utilities and the VHD disk driver in Blktap.
