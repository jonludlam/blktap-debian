Package: libvhd
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: VHD file format access library
  Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) is a file format standard which maps logical
  hard disk contents to a physical disk image format, which can then
  be more efficiently stored in a variety of different storage types,
  such as file systems or logical volumes.
  .
  VHDs are container files storing block metadata alongside a virtual
  disk's contents, in a single disk image. The metadata enables
  advanced storage backend capabilities, such as thin provisioning,
  disk image snapshotting, and coalescing of differencing disks.
  .
  Libvhd is a library to access VHD format metadata. It provides disk
  image initialization, inspection and manipulation to both VHD user
  utilities and the VHD disk driver in Blktap.

Package: vhd-utils
Architecture: any

	 libvhd (= ${binary:Version}), libvhdio (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Utilities to work with VHD disk images files.
  This package contains user utilties to inspect, test, and manipulate
  Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) images through libvhd.

Package: libvhdio
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, libvhd (= ${binary:Version})
Description: VHD standard I/O overrides.
  Libvhdio maps standard POSIX file I/O operations to VHD file I/O. On
  systems with a runtime linker supporting selective library overrides
  (LD_PRELOAD), this can sometimes be used to use standard file
  utilities on VHDs.

Description: Blktap userspace backend and drivers.
  Blktap creates kernel block devices which realize I/O requests to
  processes implementing virtual hard disk images entirely in user
  space.
  .
  Typical disk images may be implemented as files, in memory, or
  stored on other hosts across the network. The image drivers included
  with tapdisk can map disk I/O to sparse file images accessed through
  Linux DIO/AIO and VHD images with snapshot functionality.
  .
  This packages includes the control utilities needed to create
  destroy and manipulate devices ('tap-ctl'), the 'tapdisk' driver
  program to perform tap devices I/O, and a number of image drivers.
